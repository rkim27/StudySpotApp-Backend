# StudySpotApp-Backend (localhost version)

Backend for StudySpotApp, an app where people can find the availability of rooms and how crowded libraries are at their schools. There is also capability to add and edit their school if it has not been added already to the site

App hosted later in heroku but not shown in this repo. The react frontend files for this app can be found under "StudySpotApp-Frontend" in my repositories.
